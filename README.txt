This repository contains tools to download and detrend young star light-curves for exoplanetary searches, including LOWESS-detrending, peak-cutting and interpolation of stellar trends over potential transits.

This is a streamlined version of a larger pipeline still under development, so improvements can be expected later. 

Feel free to use these tools for your own work, but please cite Battley et al. (in prep.).
